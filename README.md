I've added in package.json dependencies from my project, so you can just npm i

Steps to reproduce
1) Define in postman 'Content-Type' header with 'raw' value
2) In Body field check 'raw' and add some data (for example, http://pastebin.com/qad4E9DK)
3) Run server (npm start) and make post request on 'localhost:3002'
